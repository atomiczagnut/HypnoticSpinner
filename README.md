# Hypnotic Spinner

When I really don't know what I was doing with React, I took the logo spinning on the first page and, I started messing with settings.  

I changed the React logo to my own, and started speeding up the animation.  Then I thought to add a slider.  After a long night of messing around, I ended up with this!

TODO:
* Change the slider to have logarthmic behavior
