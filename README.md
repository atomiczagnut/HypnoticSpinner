# Hypnotic Spinner

I really don't know what I'm doing, but when I saw the React logo spinning on the first page it gives you, I started messing with settings.  

I changed the React logo to my own, and started speeding up the animation.  Then I thought to add a slider.  After a long night of messing around, I ended up with this!
